    I am an aspiring data scientist with a career background in pension administration and actuarial analysis. Having
    taken substantial higher level math courses in college, I went on to take a job performing actuarial valuations on
    pension plans. In this context, I have become comfortable with the logic of database queries and with analysing the
    results of those queries. An advanced user of Microsoft Excel, I have also attained skills with VBA, Python, and
    SQL. I think analytically and thoroughly enjoy the puzzle-solving process behind querying, analysing, and
    visualizing data. I am currently attending the University of Denver Data Analytics Bootcamp in which I am developing
    these skills at a rapid pace.

    I am from Albuquerque, New Mexico, where I attended the University of New Mexico. I met my future wife in
    Albuquerque and have been happily married to her since 2005. I have been working in the Pension
    Actuarial/Administrative Industry for close to ten years, where I have learned the value of organization, time
    management, complex regulatory analysis, and client-facing presentations.
